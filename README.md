# Welcome!

## Purpose

This site is meant to act as a resource bridge between our tech teams and PSEs, to better inform eachother and our clients of the business risks and rammifications of their tech decisions.

The goal is to document as much about all elements of an optimal development environment, to give clarity and transparency, particularly surrounding our Tech Audit process.

To get started, take a look at the current Audit Checklist. You can get a general understanding of what we look for as we seek answers to the questions on the checklist, and dive deeper into the terminology and concepts used to make these evaluations.

To suggest a term/concept or point to be added to the checklist, contact Kara.
