# Gems

A Gem is a ruby library (or a dependency) packaged for use by others in their Ruby Programs and applications.

## Where is this used?

A set of gems are brought together in a Gemfile, and when you prepare your app to work, the gemfile is used like a grocery list that the Bundler will use to go to the Grocery store (AKA ruby-gems.org, the Community host for all published Gems) to pick up the particular version (or latest version) needed. These gems would be considered *dependencies* of your application.

## Why is this important?

Gems are how developers share best practices, through utilizing popular, tested, and mantained gems. These gems contribute to the functionality AND size of your application. Keeping the gems up to date, and choosing only gems you need and are actively using, keeps your application happy and healthy.
