# Third Party Services & Integrations

A 3rd party service or integration is something being used, not specifically within the app, but supports features outside the app, and the development team does not have control over.

## Where is this used?

3rd party services are typically configured for use with the app, and accessed separately, either for internal purposes like Monitoring and Error notification, or for external purposes like Marketing email, and Analytics.

## Why is this important?

It is very unlikely to find an application that does not have 3rd party services and integrations, The important thing is knowing how they're being used, and having access to them via credentials. Some services are reccomended by us to use, and it's a good sign if those integrations are already being used.

## Rubric

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="😁 Great" %}
😁

Services are being used appropriately, they're being kept up, there is documentation for how to use them, and we have clear access to them.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="😌 Meh" %}
😌

Services are being used, and we have access to them
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="😟 Uh-Oh" %}
😟

Not sure if services are being used, and there are some services we'll have to configure for use.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="🔥 Fire" %}
🔥

Have no idea if services are being used, there are a bunch of them and no info about them, there are hard-coded credentials for them, or they're littered all over the site with no documentation of their use.
