# Credentials

Any identifying info needed to get access to a resource, library, account, etc.

## Where is this used?

Typically, we see this in the form of a username and password, but there are other types of credentials that are used for access, such as a token, a key, an email. Anywhere we don't have public access, there's likely a credential we'll need.

## Why is this important?

Showing up to a locked door is the worst! When we don't have the adequate access, it keeps us from seeing what we need to see, or performing the work we need to perform.

Aditionally, it's important to consider any kind of credential as a valuable piece of information that needs to be secure and taken care of. any indication that credentials are being treated with no regard for a client's safety, is a bad sign.
