# Credentials

Any identifying info needed to get access to a resource, library, account, etc.

## Where is this used?

Typically, we see this in the form of a username and password, but there are other types of credentials that are used for access, such as a token, a key, an email. Anywhere we don't have public access, there's likely a credential we'll need.

## Why is this important?

Showing up to a locked door is the worst! When we don't have the adequate access, it keeps us from seeing what we need to see, or performing the work we need to perform.

Aditionally, it's important to consider any kind of credential as a valuable piece of information that needs to be secure and taken care of. any indication that credentials are being treated with no regard for a client's safety, is a bad sign.

GREAT

* credentials are well documented, accurate, and secure! There are different sets of credentials per environment and developer

  MEH

* we didn't get the credentials we need, or the credentials aren't well documented. but don't worry, they're safe & secure.

  UHOH

* some credentials are missing, out of date, or in a public place/hard-coded.

  FIRE!

* there are no credentials, or they're just flailing in the wind, with production-only credentials!
