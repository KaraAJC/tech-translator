# Specs

This usually means Tests, or "specifications" documented as tests.

## Where is this used?

Specs cover a range of tests that validate how the application is intended to work. From Unit tests to system tests, specs cover the codebase and each new piece of code, is expected to be documented to show how a successful use, a failure, and other cases of behavior expected of the code.

## Why is this important?

Tests give context to the code. It documents behavior, and gives confidence to the dev team that when a change is made, you can expect what should happen. It allows for communication of unexpected rammifications of the codebase, and leaves a security net for developers to take risks, and refactor for higher quality code.

## Rubric

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="😁 Great" %}
😁

There are lots and lots of tests, that are well documented, and cover varying scenarios.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="😌 Meh" %}
😌

There are some tests, and I could easily see how changes to the codebase will affect existing code.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="😟 Uh-Oh" %}
😟

There aren't many tests at all, we'll have to take time cleaning this up, and step carefully when making changes.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="🔥 Fire" %}
🔥

No tests! This is not good! We're living in the wild wild west!
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
